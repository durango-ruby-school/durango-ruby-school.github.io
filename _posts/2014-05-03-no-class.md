Class is cancelled on Monday, April 5th, because the BizLink Colorado team is preparing for their pitch in Denver. We will resume class on Monday, April 12th.

If you haven't seen it yet, check out https://bizlinkcolorado.com. It's built on Rails and has 1.2 million business listings from the Colorado Secretary of State. Any help you could provide getting business owners to claim their listings and start making connections with other businesses, would be greatly appreciated.
