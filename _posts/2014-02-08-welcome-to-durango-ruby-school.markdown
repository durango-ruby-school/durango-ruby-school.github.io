Greetings future rails developers,

We are very excited to be getting this group together to offer a structured Ruby on Rails program.  This program will start at the beginning so no programming experience is required.  We know that some of you write code in other languages or have been doing independent rails training, but we want to start fresh so everyone is on the same page.

The group will be meeting Monday evenings from 5:30pm till 7:30pm at Durango Space, but we will be creating a public HipChat so everyone can stay on the same page and get questions answered during the week. There will be homework throughout the week in an effort to let us progress as fast as possible.

Although the course is free, you will also need to sign up for a couple paid services for training materials.

* Thoughtbot Learn Workshops -  $99/month (https://learn.thoughtbot.com/prime) - Needed for the first week
* GitHub Account - Free - Needed for the first week (you will need a GitHub username to sign up for Thoughtbot Learn Workshops)
* Code School - $29/month (https://www.codeschool.com/) - Needed later on

Our first meeting will be this coming Monday the 10th.  The plan is to get everyone set up with accounts for the various services we will be using and start writing some basic ruby.

We are very excited about everyones enthusiasm for this program.  We could see the people coming out of this first training program helping recruit and train new developers in the area in the future and really building the Ruby community here in Durango.  If that is to happen I think we will need to come up with a better name than Rail Training Program so suggestions are welcome!

See you all on Monday!
