Welcome to the first night of Durang Ruby School. Here are some notes from the class.

### Accounts to set up

1. [Github][2] - Hosts open source and commercial project source code. When choosing a username, make sure
    it's professional since this will be your serve as your open source resume and follow you for the rest of your career.
2. [Nitrous.io][1] - This will be your development environment for the class. Sign up with your newly created Github account.
3. [Thoughtbot Learn][3] - Great rails training material. You will need to sign up for the Learn Workshops
    subscription ($99/month) for our class materials.
4. [Code School][4] - Interactive coding challenges. You will need to create a free account, but you don't need to enroll yet

### Trying out ruby

1. Install [Nitrous.io chrome app][5]
2. Create new Ruby on Rails box. This is your development machine from this point forward. No need to
   set up more boxes.
3. Click on IDE view for your box
4. Get ruby version. Good to know when looking at documentation.

    ```bash
    action@durango-instructor-rails-76891:~$ ruby -v
    ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27 revision 41674) [x86_64-linux]
    ```
5. Create a file under ~ called hello.rb
6. Add the following code into hello.rb

    ```ruby
    puts "Hello Ruby!"
    ```

    Save
7. In the terminal

    ```bash
    action@durango-instructor-rails-76891:~$ ruby hello.rb
    Hello Ruby
    ```
8. The rest of the code was demostrated live in class. If you want to see it, you can check out my [notes][8].
