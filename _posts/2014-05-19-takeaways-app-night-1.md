Tonight we start on our first real client app. We will be using Ruby 2.1.2 and Rails 4.1.1

Upgrading ruby (using rvm)

  1. `rvm get head` - upgrades rvm
  2. `rvm install 2.1.2` - installs the latest version of ruby
  3. `ruby -v` to check that we're using ruby 2.1.2p95

Install latest rails

  1. `gem install rails`
  2. `rails -v` to ensure we're using rails 4.1.1

Downloading setting up the project

  1. cd into your workspace directory
  2. Clone the [durango-ruby-school/takeaways][1] repo. Use the SSH clone url.
  3. cd into the takeaways folder and follow the setup instructions in README.md
