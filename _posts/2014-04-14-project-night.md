This week, students will apply the skills they have learned by working on the Readathon 2 app. Students are
encouraged to pair.

1. Find a person you want to work with
2. Fork the [Readathon2][1] repo so you can have your own copy.
3. Clone the app in your workspace directory

    ```
    $ cd workspace
    $ git clone git@github.com:<your username>/readathon2.git
    ```

4. cd into the project
5. Bundle install
6. Follow the setup instructions in the readme.


### Goals

1. Have a working homepage developed using TDD
2. Build the student CRUD actions using TDD

#Resources

1. [Capybara Reference][2]
2. [Rails url helpers][3]

### Homework

1. Build out the CRUD actions for books using TDD. Push your code back up to your Github fork and
send me an email (aaron@animascodelabs.com) if you would like me to review your
code.
