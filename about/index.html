      <p>Durango Ruby School was started in 2014 by a small group of passionate Ruby developers to spread the Ruby gospel and inspire Rails development. Co-founders Aaron Renner and Tristan Rubadeau formulated the idea at a Durango Coders event about the Jekyll blogging platform. They decided that we needed more Ruby and Rails developers in Durango and the best way to do it would be through a didactic effort to share the collective knowledge and experience of local developers. Aaron immediately jumped in head first, compiling a curriculum to engage programmers at all levels. Together with the other instructors, he used the Thoughtbot Rails tutorials to guide the design and content of the course. </p>
      <p>Durango Ruby School is completely free and consists of structured weekly classes taught at the SCAPE offices.</p>
